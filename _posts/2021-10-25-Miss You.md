i said i miss you like water
you asked why water
coz sometimes water run like stream
sometimes water rush like flood
sometimes water sound like whisper
sometimes water sound like roar

you asked why i start writing a poem
i said may be i am a artist in my bone

you said impossible
i said you are a pig
