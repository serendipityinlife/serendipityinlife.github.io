i said i miss you like water <br/>
you asked why water <br/>
coz sometimes water run like stream <br/>
sometimes water rush like flood <br/>
sometimes water sound like whisper <br/>
sometimes water sound like roar <br/>
<br/>
you asked why i start writing a poem <br/>
i said may be i am a artist in my bone <br/>
<br/>
you said that's impossible <br/>
i said you are a pig <br/>
