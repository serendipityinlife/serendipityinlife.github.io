@ nearby <br/>
<br/>
Knowing that she is nearby he is struggling <br/>
He acts like a stalker when he knows which building she is located, which is not good and actually he done that before <br/>
He wants nothing but just to take a look on the person at alive, better if in smile <br/>
Oh it occurs to him that they still have one item in to do list, to do a walk togather on the street on the city they grow up <br/>
It would be fun if they are in school uniform <br/>
