@ Dream
 
<br/>
Last night he dreamed that , at night, they're taking a walk hand in hand after he played basketball. and he can feel the touch of her hand.
<br/>
<br/>
her hair become longer that pass her shoulders. She suddenly dragging his hand run with laugh
<br/>
<br/>
they sweat inside out and go take showers and play in the bathroom
<br/>
<br/>
and on bed, with she lies - facing to the bed , and he lies on her
<br/>
<br/>
what a dream
<br/>
