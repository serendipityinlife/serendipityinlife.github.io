I could stay awake just to hear you breathing<br/>
Watch you smile while you are sleeping<br/>
While you're far away and dreaming<br/>
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender<br/>
I could stay lost in this moment forever<br/>
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure<br/>
Don't want to close my eyes<br/>
I don't want to fall asleep<br/>
'Cause I'd miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
'Cause even when I dream of you<br/>
The sweetest dream will never do<br/>
I'd still miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating<br/>
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming<br/>
Wondering if it's me you're seeing<br/>
Then I kiss your eyes<br/>
And thank God we're together<br/>
And I just want to stay with you in this moment forever<br/>
Forever and ever<br/>
I don't want to close my eyes<br/>
I don't want to fall asleep<br/>
'Cause I'd miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
'Cause even when I dream of you<br/>
The sweetest dream will never do<br/>
I'd still miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
I don't want to miss one smile<br/>
And I don't want to miss one kiss<br/>
And I just want to be with you<br/>
Right here with you, just like this<br/>
And I just want to hold you close<br/>
I feel your heart so close to mine<br/>
And just stay here in this moment<br/>
For all the rest of time<br/>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br/>
Don't want to close my eyes<br/>
Don't want to fall asleep<br/>
'Cause I'd miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)<br/>
The sweetest dream will never do<br/>
I'd still miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
I don't want to close my eyes<br/>
I don't want to fall asleep<br/>
'Cause I'd miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
'Cause even when I dream of you<br/>
The sweetest dream will never do<br/>
I'd still miss you baby<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
Don't want to close my eyes<br/>
I don't want to fall asleep, yeah<br/>
And I don't want to miss a thing<br/>
