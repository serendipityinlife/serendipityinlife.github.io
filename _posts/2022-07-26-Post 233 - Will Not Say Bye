<br/>

the first time he knows about she came to live in the same city he will visit, he was happy, for whatever reason

back in Hong Kong he imaged if she and he both in shenzhen, he will skipping some calls and fuck the works and go to meet her at office hour

he imaged that they will spending time togather at some coffee shops, or the coffee shop she owns, she is doing the reading and he keeps typing, just like what they did in the "living room"

but he always lives in his imagination, and the reality does not fit at all, especially 2022

"everytime they met is to say bye"

the words makes him sad. 

he was very happy when he met her and kept his eyes on her cannot move away, (making the waitress feeling interupting them even just want to add water for them)

he was sad when he needs to say bye

he was very happy when he had another chance to meet her

and seeing her away again is (↓)

she said she throught he is moving on, he is a bit down coz actually he doesnot but keep falling in the past 

when she said she is moving on a bit time by time, of coz he is feeling lost but , if that makes her feel good, ...

super纠结

and he still has a lot of idea about her , a lot lot

maybe here is where is appropriate to put the notes. 

will not say bye to you
