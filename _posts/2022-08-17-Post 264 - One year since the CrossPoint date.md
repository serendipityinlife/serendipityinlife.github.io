@ Bedroom


<br/>
lots of thoughts in his mind about how he will be a part or her Hong Kong Serendipity Journey, in the mid night of 17 Aug 2021
<br/>
<br/>
all with smiling faces 
<br/>
<br/>
but never thinking about crashing her some day and be moved out of her love list 
<br/>
<br/>
deleted words wrote before as he finally awares that he always thinking in his own way until he was reminded and reminded again that he lost her love 
<br/>
those words seem inappropriate, like a embarrassing clown
<br/>
<br/>
he does adore her, than before, with him feels negative emotions, more and more when seeing trails with her
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
anyway he does wishes she having a new serendipity journey in the new city with possibility
<br/>
and smiles and feels the city that could brings her much much dopamine
